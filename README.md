This is a Hashcat based hash breaker that runs through some of the most 
popular medium weight wordlists before asking permission to move to rule based attacks and finally brute force.
The wordlists must be pre-downloaded from the site of your choice, names are included in the script but your directories
must be updated in the script prior to use. 

Shoutout to OpenAI's Monday model for assisting in making this a more fun script to use, the language and design
makes this the most fun hash breaker I have used.
